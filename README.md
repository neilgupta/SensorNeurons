# Ann Sensor Neurons

Arduino code for passing different data from sensor to Ann via Xbee series 2 network. This just collects raw sensor data and tells us when something happened, without sending the value of the data itself.

There's also example code for receiving messages on arduinos.

This project is meant to be used in conjunction with [AnnCNS](https://github.com/neilgupta/AnnCNS) and [Ann](https://github.com/neilgupta/Ann).
